## [FEATURE DEMONSTRATION - 0:20-3:00]

### Feature 1: Student Management (0:30 min)
**[Click on Home page]**

"First, we have student management. Here I can view all students, create new ones, edit their info, or delete records. It's straightforward - just fill in the form with student details and the data is saved."

**[Do a quick demo - create or show a student]**

"As you can see, adding students is simple and organized."

### Feature 2: Health Dashboard (1:15 min)
**[Navigate to Health Dashboard]**

"This is the main dashboard - the heart of the application. It shows:

**Statistics Cards:** Total students checked, average BMI, records this year, and system status

**Analytics Charts:** We have two interactive charts showing health distribution by BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese), and average weight trends by school year. This helps track student health patterns."

**[Point to the charts]**

### Feature 3: Add Health Records (1:00 min)
**[Click "Add Health Record" button]**

"The main feature - adding health records. When I click this button, a form appears where I can:
- Select a student
- Enter the check-up date
- Record physical measurements - weight and height
- Input vital signs - blood pressure readings and temperature
- Add vision and urine test results

The system automatically calculates BMI and determines the student's health category. Let me add a record to show you..."

**[Fill in sample data and submit]**

"And it's saved! The new record appears in the table below."

### Feature 4: Recent Check-ups Table (0:45 min)
**[Show the table]**

"Below the dashboard, we have the Recent Check-ups table showing the 10 latest health records. Each row shows:
- Student ID and name
- Check-up date and all measurements
- Calculated BMI with color-coded status (green for normal, blue for elevated, orange for stage 1, red for stage 2 hypertension)

I can click any student name to see their full health history with weight and BMI trends over time."

**[Click on a student briefly to show history]**

### Feature 5: All Records View (0:30 min)
**[Navigate to All Records page]**

"Finally, we have the All Records page where we can see all health data in one place with powerful filters - search by student name or ID, filter by department, school year, or health category. This makes it easy to find specific records or generate reports."
